# Multiclass-Problem-US-Hospital-Readmissions
This repository collects a university project made during the Academic Year 2024-2025 for the course "Statistical Learning For Healthcare Data". Our aim was to test several classification approaches the multiclass problem of hospital readmission in US among diabetic patients, using the popular related dataset available online.
Data are available on https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/296/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008. The project is divided in 2 main parts: the first is a dataset creation and data preprocessing, followed by the core analysis, a multiclass problem where various strategies have been used to classify the patients in 3 different categories (NO hospital readmissions, early readmissions, late readmissions). 
One key challeng in the early stages of the analysis was to make it as robust as possible: the dataset presented a huge unbalanceness among different classes and we have decided to try to solve it applying SMOTENC, a version of SMOTE used in cases of datasets with both continuous and categorical features (chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07612).
Different classificators have been tested (Random Forest, Logistic Regression and AdaBoost), trying to maximize their performance in different ways (adding polynomial features, performing feature selection) if the models were overfitting or underfitting. At the end, we have tried to enhance the overall final performance by building a majority voting ensemble method picking the best implementations of the tested models.
