# Multiclass-Problem-US-Hospital-Readmissions
This repository collects a university project made during the Academic Year 2024-2025 for the course "Statistical Learning For Healthcare Data". Our aim was to test several classification approaches the multiclass problem of hospital readmission in US among diabetic patients, using the popular related dataset available online.
Data are available on https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/296/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008. The project is divided in 2 main parts: the first is a dataset creation and data preprocessing, followed by the core analysis, a multiclass problem where various strategies have been used to classify the patients in 3 different categories (NO hospital readmissions, early readmissions, late readmissions).
